# KaggleCodes

This repo records my projects on Kaggle.

[boosting-prediction-titanic.ipynb](https://github.com/LetianY/KaggleCodes/blob/main/boosting-prediction-titanic.ipynb) gives the survival prediction on Titanic dataset. CatBoost classification model and several feature engineering techniques are implemented. I picked up python regular expression from this notebook.

[covid-19-vaccination-progress-and-prediction-trial.ipynb](https://github.com/LetianY/KaggleCodes/blob/main/covid-19-vaccination-progress-and-prediction-trial.ipynb) is a part of my course project of SEEM2460. The notebooks uses PyTorch to implement the traditional SIR model, but with a new factor counted in. The full project also includes covid info analysis using Tableau and sentiment analysis on Twitter, which is not shown here.

[wids-2021-notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/LetianY/KaggleCodes/blob/main/wids-2021-notebook.ipynb) is a notebook to prediction whether paients admitted to ICU gets a special type of diabetes mellitus. The model is a simple LGBM one, but it's always interesting to explore the feature and learn techniques to impute data.
